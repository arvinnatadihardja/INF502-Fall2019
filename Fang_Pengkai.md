HW 1 part2:

Title: Racial Orders in American Political Development

Venue: Cambridge University Press

Number of pages: 27

outcomes:

1.Many studies on racial issues lack a clear theoretical explanation of racial and political relations.

2.The intrinsic motivation of American racial order, the interaction between them, and the relationship with other aspects of American political life are often so important that the question of what role a race might play should always be part of political science.

3.The failure of political scientists to adequately address racial issues in scholarships is largely a part of the failure of Americans to adequately address racial issues in their common lives.
