* Title: Neural Network-Based Face Detection
* Venue: Journal of IEEE
* A number of pages:16 pgs.
* Outcomes:

      * 1.A neural network-based upright frontal face detection system.
      * 2.The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve the performance of a single network. A simple program to align examples of positive training. Use the bootstrap algorithm to collect the reverse example bootstrap algorithm and add error detection to the training set during training.
      * 3.Compare performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates.
